This should also work for the Pi 4.

I followed the excellent steps outlined by u/DigitalDangerNoodle/ in this post and their pastebin here.

I used a RPI 3 b+ and followed the steps to the point of power on. At that point, I connected my pi via a network cable and the NIC and used an external keyboard/monitor to directly log into my PI and make changes so that I could access it as another device on my network. These are the changes I made instead of the USB0 / direct connection to a computer.

**Pastebin Step line 108-155 replacement**

Step 5**)** Boot pwnagotchi for the first time, connected via NIC (will boot into MANU Mode). Use local access.

Step 6) Configure network/internet access for RPI 3 b+ / 4

#Comment out the entirety of the /etc/network/interfaces.d/usb0-cfg network config file.

#Add your eth0 configuration

sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces.d/eth0-cfg

#Add information specific to your network. My network is 10.0.0.0.

Allow-hotplug eth0

Iface eth0 inet static

address 10.0.0.2

netmask 255.255.255.0

network 10.0.0.1

broadcast 10.0.0.255

gateway 10.0.0.1

dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8

#DNS

#The resolveconf program is responsible for auto-generating the resolve.conf file during boot based on the files in /etc/network/interfaces.d/

sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces.d/eth0-cfg

# add "dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8" under the final 'Gateway' line

#(NOTE: This step was already completed above, I only add it here for clarity)

sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf

# modify "nameserver 127.0.0.1" to be "nameserver 8.8.8.8"

sudo nano /etc/dnsmasq.conf

# add "server=8.8.8.8@eth0"

sudo systemctl disable dnsmasq

sudo chattr +i /etc/resolv.conf

# make file immutable

sudo reboot

ping Google.com #test for network connection
